Great!

Let's jump on a quick 15-min call so I can understand your current setup and show you exactly how we'd work with [their company/artist].

### Asking About Price
```
Depends on the scope - we customize based on volume and goals.

Typically ranges from $2-5K/month for most clients, but I'd need to understand your situation first.

### Skeptical
```
Fair question.

Most agencies post on 1-2 accounts and call it a day. We build a network of 20-50+ pages that post daily - it's volume + consistency that makes the difference.

Happy to show you case studies on a quick call if you're curious: [CALENDAR LINK]

No pressure either way.

```

### Not Interested
```
Got it - thanks for letting me know.

Best of luck with everything!

## 🚨 Common Objections & Responses

**"We've tried this before"**
→ "What didn't work about it?" (then differentiate on volume/scale)

**"How is this different from posting ourselves?"**
→ "It's not just posting - it's about volume. We post 100-500 times per day across dozens of accounts. You can't do that manually."

**"Isn't this spam?"**
→ "Not at all - it's distribution. Same way Netflix puts the same show on multiple channels. Your content, our distribution network."

**"Do you guarantee results?"**
→ "We guarantee volume and consistency. Results depend on content quality and market fit. But we track everything and optimize as we go."

**"This sounds expensive"**
→ "Consider the alternative: hiring a team to do this in-house would cost 10x more. This is the most cost-effective way to scale short-form distribution."
